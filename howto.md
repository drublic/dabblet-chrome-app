3. Click the button "load unpacked extensions" (or something similar to this - I've got a german interface)
4. Navigate to the repo's folder "app" and choose it
5. You get the app on your Chrome's Dashboard

## Upload the App

You need to have the dabblet.com domain registered in the [Google Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/) with the same Google Account because of security issues.
